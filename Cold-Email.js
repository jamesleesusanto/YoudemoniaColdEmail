    <p>Good Morning!</p>

    <p>My name is ` + name_of_sender + `, and I am ` + intro_of_sender + ` and the ` + position_at_youdemonia + ` of a student-led nonprofit organization called Youdemonia. 

    Our organization works to connect youth with educational opportunities hosted by civic organizations to increase youth engagement in the community.

    </p>



    <p>Today, thousands of youth-focused academic resources are offered annually, yet many students fail to utilize them because they do not know they exist or don't have the time to properly utilize them. 



    That was...until now! Youdemonia is building YouConnect - an online "one-stop shop" where students can find a variety of events, workshops, and other career-building opportunities without any hassle.</p>



    <p><b>I was impressed by your organizationâ€™s impact thus far and would love to schedule a 20 minute call to talk about how we can work together to push your resources out to more youth through our platform (free to use)!</b></p>



    <p>My availability is listed <a href = ` + calendly_link + `> here</a>, would love to chat anytime convenient if your team is interested in engaging more students!</p>



    <p>Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>

    

    <p>--<br>

    <b>` + name_of_sender + `</b><br>

    ` + position_at_youdemonia + `, <a href="http://www.youdemonia.org">Youdemonia</a><br>
